Are you a minimalist? This plugin is for you.

WordPress comes with List and Excerpt view modes by default.

This plugin adds a third mode called Compact, which allows you to fit more posts on the screen without scrolling.

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/fjarrett/compact-view-mode). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues reported](https://github.com/fjarrett/compact-view-mode/issues) there before going to the plugin forum.**
